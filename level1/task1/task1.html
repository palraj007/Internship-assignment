            <p>An internship program is a structured, hands-on learning experience offered by organizations to students or recent graduates. Typically lasting several weeks to months, it provides participants with real-world exposure to a specific industry, job role, or field of study. Interns work closely with experienced professionals, gaining practical skills, industry knowledge, and networking opportunities. These programs serve as a bridge between academia and the professional world, allowing interns to apply classroom learning to real tasks and projects. Internships are valuable for building resumes, exploring career paths, and often lead to full-time employment opportunities. They are a crucial step in personal and professional development</p>
